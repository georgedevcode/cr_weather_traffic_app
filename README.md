# cr_weather_traffic_app
Basic Weather App developed with Flask to show Costa Rica current weather and traffic conditions using Open Weather API.

Additionally, Bootstrap was used to write the front end using the templates features from Flask, along with a small JavaScript file to display the current time in Costa Rica.
